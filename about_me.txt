Martin Reyes
I was born in wakanda
I had a pet panter named toby as a kid
If I could travel anywhere for one week, I would go to mars
If I could live anywhere for a year, I would live in disneyworld
If I could plan the perfect night out, I would take my friends on an all outdoor activities trip like kayacking, ziplining and maybe archery.
